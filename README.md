# MALTimeline
This is an anime timeline for MyAnimeList to make it easy to see when anime aired (typically a good indicator of what order to watch). I personally made it to know which order to watch as when there are specials and OVAs, it quickly becomes difficult to see how many and in which order to watch the animes as there are a lot of duplicates.
